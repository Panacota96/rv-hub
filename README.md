# RV Hub

<!-- forge:description -->
**Main app for the Rakvor tools.** Finds the installed tools, checks their signatures, launches them on a case folder, shows the case at a glance and verifies the whole case.

## What you get

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Two ways to use it** | `rv-hub` (command line) and `rv-hub-gui` (Windows 10/11 desktop app). Same engine, same results. |
| **Single or bulk** | One file, many files, whole folders (`--recursive`) or a list file (`--input-list`). |
| **Hashing** | Choose 1 or 2 of md5, sha1, sha256, sha512, sha3-256, blake3. Both are computed in the same read. |
| **Progress** | Progress bar, elapsed time, throughput and estimated time remaining (CLI and GUI). Cancel at any time. |
| **Auditable** | Every action goes to `logs/<RUN-ID>/audit.jsonl`, where each entry carries the hash of the previous one. `verify-log` detects any edit. |
| **Reports** | A statistics report per run, and for **each file** a technical review and a customer summary — HTML, PDF and JSON, in English, Spanish or French. |
| **Case folder** | `--case-dir` links the Rakvor tools of one case: rv-hub (the intake tool) registers each file as `E0001`, `E0002`, … so later tools prove they examined bit-identical copies; `verify-case` checks the whole folder. See [docs/case-folder.md](docs/case-folder.md). |

## Install

**Windows 10/11** — download from the [Releases](https://github.com/Panacota96/rv-hub/releases) page:

- `rv-hub-<version>-windows-x64-setup.exe` — installer (Start-menu shortcut, adds the CLI to PATH), or
- `rv-hub-<version>-windows-x64.zip` — portable: unzip and run, nothing is installed.

Check the download before use (see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md#verifying-a-release)).

**From source** (any OS, Rust 1.85+):

```bash
cargo build --release
# binaries: target/release/rv-hub and target/release/rv-hub-gui
```

## Quick start

```powershell
# Check the build first: every algorithm against published test vectors
rv-hub self-test

# Review a folder with SHA-256 + MD5, reports in Spanish, for case CASE-2026-014
rv-hub scan -i D:\evidence -r --hash sha256,md5 --lang es --case CASE-2026-014 --actor "Ana Ruiz"

# French case: custody form in French + English, every PDF signed with your certificate
$env:RV_SIGN_PASSWORD = Read-Host -AsSecureString | ConvertFrom-SecureString -AsPlainText
rv-hub scan -i D:\evidence -r --jurisdiction fr --sign-cert C:\certs\examiner.p12 --lang fr

# Later, prove the log was not altered (also checks the RFC 3161 timestamp)
rv-hub verify-log rakvor-out\logs\<RUN-ID>

# The run was offline? Add the trusted timestamp once the network is back
rv-hub timestamp rakvor-out\logs\<RUN-ID>
```

Every option, example and exit code: [docs/usage-cli.md](docs/usage-cli.md) (generated from `--help`).
The desktop app: [docs/usage-gui.md](docs/usage-gui.md). A ready-made sample: [examples/](examples/README.md).

## Outputs

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    OUT["&lt;OUT&gt;/"] --> LOGS["logs/&lt;RUN-ID&gt;/"]
    OUT --> REP["reports/&lt;RUN-ID&gt;/"]
    LOGS --> L1["audit.jsonl — chained actions"]
    LOGS --> L2["audit.log — same, readable"]
    LOGS --> L3["hashes.csv — hash register"]
    LOGS --> L4["environment.json — versions, OS, host"]

    IT --> K["custody.json / custody.es|fr + .en .html/.pdf"]
    LOGS --> L5["timestamp-N.tsr — RFC 3161 token"]
```

| Exit code | Meaning |
| :-: | --- |
| 0 | Completed, no high-severity finding |
| 1 | Runtime error |
| 2 | Usage error (e.g. three hash algorithms) |
| 3 | Completed with high-severity findings / broken audit chain |
| 130 | Cancelled (partial reports written) |
