# Installation and verification (Windows 10/11)

RV Hub runs **locally** on the examiner's Windows 10 or 11 PC (x64). It needs no administrator rights, no
runtime (static C runtime) and no network, except for the optional RFC 3161 timestamp. This page covers: getting a
release, **proving it is the genuine build**, installing it (portable zip or per-user installer), the first-run
self-test, offline use, building from source for auditors, where files live, and uninstalling.

Why verification matters: a court may ask how you know the program you ran is the one whose source an expert
reviewed. Steps 2–4 and 6 produce that answer; keep their output with the case file
([admissibility.md](admissibility.md#examiner-checklist-before-filing-a-report), step 3).

## Requirements

| Item | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| Operating system | Windows 10 or 11, x64 (`MinVersion=10.0`, `ArchitecturesAllowed=x64compatible` in the installer). Linux/macOS: build from source. |
| Rights | Standard user. The installer is per-user (`PrivilegesRequired=lowest`). |
| Disk | The two executables and the docs (a few MB); outputs need about 11 report files per item for one language (19 with `--lang all`) plus the logs. |
| Memory | Files are streamed in 1 MiB chunks: memory use does not grow with file size. |
| Graphics | None required: the GUI also runs on VMs without a GPU driver (software rendering). |
| Network | None, except the optional timestamp request (see [step 7](#7-offline-and-air-gapped-use)). |

## 1. Download

Release assets on the GitHub Releases page of the repository (`rakvor/rv-hub`):

| Asset | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `rv-hub-X.Y.Z-windows-x64.zip` | Portable: `rv-hub.exe`, `rv-hub-gui.exe`, README, LICENSE, NOTICE, CHANGELOG, `docs/`, `examples/` |
| `rv-hub-X.Y.Z-windows-x64-setup.exe` | Inno Setup installer, per-user |
| `SHA256SUMS` | SHA-256 of the zip, the installer and the SBOM (`sha256sum` format: `<hash>  ./<file>`) |
| `sbom.cdx.json` | CycloneDX software bill of materials (every Rust dependency and version) |

Put them in one folder, e.g. `C:\Rakvor\downloads\rv-hub-0.1.0\`.

## 2. Verify the download

```powershell
cd C:\Rakvor\downloads\rv-hub-0.1.0
Get-Content .\SHA256SUMS | ForEach-Object {
    $hash, $name = $_ -split '\s+', 2
    $name = $name.TrimStart('*').Replace('./', '')
    if (Test-Path $name) {
        $actual = (Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 $name).Hash.ToLower()
        if ($actual -eq $hash) { "OK    $name" } else { "FAIL  $name  (got $actual)" }
    } else { "skip  $name (not downloaded)" }
}
```

```bash
sha256sum -c --ignore-missing SHA256SUMS      # Linux, or Git Bash on Windows
```

Every downloaded file must print `OK`. `SHA256SUMS` is produced by the same workflow and is not attested itself:
step 3 is the stronger check.

## 3. Verify build provenance

Each zip and installer carries a GitHub build-provenance attestation (`actions/attest-build-provenance`): a signed
statement that this exact file was built by the repository's release workflow from a given commit. On a machine
with internet access and the GitHub CLI:

```powershell
gh attestation verify .\rv-hub-0.1.0-windows-x64.zip --repo rakvor/rv-hub
gh attestation verify .\rv-hub-0.1.0-windows-x64-setup.exe --repo rakvor/rv-hub
```

The output names the workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) and the source commit; record both. For an
air-gapped lab, verify on a connected machine and carry the verified files on write-protected media (the GitHub CLI
can also download the attestation bundle and trusted root for offline checks; see `gh attestation verify --help`).
`SHA256SUMS` and the SBOM are not attested.

## 4. Verify the Authenticode signature (signed releases)

The release workflow signs `rv-hub.exe`, `rv-hub-gui.exe` and the installer **only when a code-signing
certificate is configured** for the repository (`SIGN_PFX_BASE64` secret; signtool with SHA-256 and an RFC 3161
timestamp). Check:

```powershell
Get-AuthenticodeSignature .\rv-hub-0.1.0-windows-x64-setup.exe |
    Format-List Status, StatusMessage, SignerCertificate, TimeStamperCertificate
# after extracting the zip:
Get-AuthenticodeSignature .\rv-hub.exe, .\rv-hub-gui.exe | Format-Table Status, Path
```

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `Valid` | Signed and intact; check that the signer is the expected Rakvor entity |
| `NotSigned` | The release was built without a signing certificate: rely on steps 2–3; Windows SmartScreen will warn |
| `HashMismatch` / other | Stop: the file was altered after signing |

With the Windows SDK, `signtool verify /pa /v rv-hub.exe` shows the full chain.

## 5. Install

### 5a. Portable zip

```powershell
# only after steps 2–4
Unblock-File .\rv-hub-0.1.0-windows-x64.zip
Expand-Archive .\rv-hub-0.1.0-windows-x64.zip -DestinationPath C:\Rakvor\tools\rv-hub-0.1.0
cd C:\Rakvor\tools\rv-hub-0.1.0
.\rv-hub.exe --version
```

Keep one folder per version so a past case can be re-run with the exact version recorded in its
`environment.json`. Optional, current session only: `$env:Path += ";C:\Rakvor\tools\rv-hub-0.1.0"`.

### 5b. Installer (per-user, no administrator)

Double-click `rv-hub-X.Y.Z-windows-x64-setup.exe` (English, Spanish or French wizard). It installs to
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Rakvor\RV Hub\`, creates a *Rakvor* Start-menu group (app + documentation), and offers
two tasks: **Add the rv-hub command to PATH** (user PATH, checked on first install) and a desktop icon. Open a
**new** terminal afterwards for PATH to apply.

Unattended:

```powershell
.\rv-hub-0.1.0-windows-x64-setup.exe /VERYSILENT /SUPPRESSMSGBOXES /NORESTART /TASKS="addtopath"
```

The installer copies the executables, README, LICENSE, NOTICE, CHANGELOG, `docs\` and the sample evidence
(`examples\sample\evidence\`), not the sample scripts or `expected_hashes.csv` (those are in the zip and the source
tree).

<!-- forge:domain -->
### 5c. Native libraries

None. RV Hub is two self-contained executables: hashing, the PDF writer, the RFC 3161 client and the CMS
signer are compiled in (pure Rust crates, listed in the SBOM), and the C runtime is linked statically
(`.cargo/config.toml`). There is no DLL to verify or to keep next to the executables.
<!-- /forge:domain -->

## 6. First-run self-test and sample

```powershell
rv-hub --version
rv-hub self-test
```

`self-test` prints `PASS` for md5, sha1, sha256, sha512, sha3-256 and blake3 (known answers for `"abc"`), exit code
0. It tests the hash implementations only. Then run the synthetic sample, which exercises type detection,
duplicates, reports and the audit chain:

```powershell
# portable zip (script included): self-test, sample scan, verify-log, hashes.csv vs expected_hashes.csv
.\examples\sample\run.ps1 -Bin .\rv-hub.exe

# installer (no script installed): run it by hand into a temporary folder
$app = "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Programs\Rakvor\RV Hub"
$out = Join-Path $env:TEMP "rv-hub-check"
rv-hub scan -i "$app\examples\sample\evidence" --hash sha256,md5 --out $out --progress none --no-timestamp
$LASTEXITCODE                                  # 0
rv-hub verify-log (Get-ChildItem "$out\logs" | Select-Object -Last 1).FullName   # OK … chain intact
```

<!-- forge:domain -->
Expected summary: **3 items, 0 errors, findings high 0, medium 1, low 0, info 2**, exit code 0 (one
`EXTENSION_MISMATCH` for `foto-vacaciones.jpg`, one `DUPLICATE` pair `acta.txt` / `acta-copia.txt`). The SHA-256
column of `hashes.csv` must equal `examples\sample\expected_hashes.csv` (computed independently with Python):

| File | Size | SHA-256 |
| --- | --: | --- |
| `acta-copia.txt` | 61 | `80e089ad6704c831e386b430adf92c5f5b72ec4428566d3580660e103c183c3c` |
| `acta.txt` | 61 | `80e089ad6704c831e386b430adf92c5f5b72ec4428566d3580660e103c183c3c` |
| `foto-vacaciones.jpg` | 112 | `42503ebb0f9892b30b72e11cfa0cbf5bcb5d60f667d611fa9598c9b4e835c643` |

`run.ps1` / `run.sh` make this comparison themselves: they read the tool's `logs\<RUN-ID>\hashes.csv` and compare
size, SHA-256 and MD5 of every file with `expected_hashes.csv`, print
`hashes.csv matches expected_hashes.csv (3 files: size, SHA-256, MD5)` and exit 3 on any difference. For the
installer (no script installed), compare the table above with `$out\logs\<RUN-ID>\hashes.csv`, or run
`python tests\verify_chain.py <log folder>` from the source tree, which re-hashes every file of `hashes.csv`.
<!-- /forge:domain -->

Keep the console output and the run folder as the record of this verification.

## 7. Offline and air-gapped use

The **only** network access in the code is the RFC 3161 timestamp request (one HTTP POST of a 32-byte hash to the
TSA, [src/core/src/trust.rs](../src/core/src/trust.rs)). There is no telemetry, update check or licence check.

| To disable the timestamp | How |
| --- | --- |
| One CLI run | `--no-timestamp` |
| All CLI runs on this PC / session | `$env:RV_NO_TIMESTAMP = "1"` (or set it as a user environment variable) |
| GUI | untick **4. Trust → Trusted timestamp** before *Start review* |

An offline run with the timestamp enabled still completes: it logs `timestamp_pending` and the statistics report
shows a warning. Later, on a machine that can reach the TSA, run `rv-hub timestamp <log folder>` (it
re-verifies the chain, then appends `timestamp_obtained`). To use an internal or qualified TSA, pass `--tsa-url`
(see [admissibility.md](admissibility.md#53-eidas--regulation-eu-9102014-as-amended-by-eu-20241183)). The network
restriction is not enforced by the OS; on a connected workstation, a Windows Firewall outbound rule for
`rv-hub.exe` / `rv-hub-gui.exe` allowing only the TSA host enforces it.

## 8. Build from source for auditors

### Toolchain

| Item | Version |
| --- | --- |
| Rust | Pinned by [rust-toolchain.toml](../rust-toolchain.toml): **1.97.0** with rustfmt and clippy; `rustup` installs and selects it automatically inside the source tree. `Cargo.toml` declares `rust-version = "1.85"` (edition 2024) as the minimum. To match a release exactly, use the compiler recorded in that release's `environment.json` → `tool.rustc` (e.g. `rustc 1.97.0 (2d8144b78 2026-07-07)`). |
| Windows linker | Visual Studio 2022 Build Tools, workload *Desktop development with C++* (MSVC + Windows SDK); target `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`. Static CRT is set in `.cargo/config.toml`. |
| Linux | No system packages needed to build the CLI. |
| Optional | Python 3.12 with `blake3 jsonschema pyhanko` for the independent verifiers and the trust tests (`RV_TEST_PYTHON=python`). |

### Build

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Panacota96/rv-hub.git
cd rv-hub
git checkout v0.1.0                       # the tag of the release under review
rustc --version                           # must print the pinned 1.97.0
cargo build --release --locked -p rv-hub-cli -p rv-hub-gui
.\target\release\rv-hub.exe self-test
.\examples\sample\run.ps1 -Bin .\target\release\rv-hub.exe
cargo test --workspace --locked            # unit + integration tests (trust tests skip without pyhanko)
```

```bash
# Linux
cargo build --release --locked -p rv-hub-cli
target/release/rv-hub self-test && examples/sample/run.sh target/release/rv-hub
python3 tests/verify_chain.py examples/sample/out/logs/$(ls examples/sample/out/logs | tail -n 1)
# cross-profile: a case folder written by the Python profile must verify with this build
python3 tests/golden/unpack.py tests/golden/case-by-python.zip.b64 /tmp/golden
target/release/rv-hub verify-case /tmp/golden/CASE-GOLDEN
```

`--locked` refuses to build if `Cargo.lock` would change, so the dependency set equals the one listed in
`environment.json` → `dependencies` and in `sbom.cdx.json`. The product version comes from `version.txt`; the
crate versions in `Cargo.toml` stay fixed, so a release never changes the lock file.

### Reproducing the release hashes

Be precise about what can and cannot match bit for bit in this version (gap G22):

| Artefact | Bit-identical to the release? | How to check |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `docs/`, `examples/` files | Yes (from git; LF line endings except `*.ps1`, `*.iss`) | `git ls-files` + `Get-FileHash` against the extracted zip |
| `rv-hub.exe`, `rv-hub-gui.exe` | **Not guaranteed**: paths are not remapped and the PE header carries link-time data. The compiler is the one pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml` (both workflows run `rustup toolchain install`, which reads that file; confirm with `environment.json` → `tool.rustc` of a release run) | Provenance attestation (step 3) binds the released binary to the workflow and commit; then compare behaviour (below) |
| zip, installer | No (archive timestamps) | Attestation (step 3) |

**Functional equivalence** — run the sample with the release binary and with your build, then compare the digests
and findings of every item:

```bash
python - "<release-out>/reports/<RUN-ID>" "<your-out>/reports/<RUN-ID>" <<'EOF'
import glob, json, sys
def load(run):
    out = {}
    for p in sorted(glob.glob(f"{run}/items/*/technical.json")):
        t = json.load(open(p, encoding="utf-8"))
        out[t["item"]["file_name"]] = (t["hashes"], t["item"]["detected_type"],
                                       [(f["code"], f["severity"], f["params"]) for f in t["findings"]])
    return out
a, b = load(sys.argv[1]), load(sys.argv[2])
print("identical findings and digests" if a == b else "DIFFERENT: " + ", ".join(k for k in a if a.get(k) != b.get(k)))
EOF
```

The same script compares this build with the Python profile of the tool (measured identical on the sample).

## 9. Where things live

| What | Location |
| --- | --- |
| Program (installer) | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Rakvor\RV Hub\` (`rv-hub.exe`, `rv-hub-gui.exe`, `docs\`, `examples\sample\evidence\`, `unins000.exe`) |
| Program (portable) | the folder you extracted |
| PATH entry (installer task) | user environment variable `Path` (`HKCU\Environment`) |
| Run outputs | `--out` (default `.\rakvor-out` **relative to the current folder**): `logs\<RUN-ID>\`, `reports\<RUN-ID>\`. With `--case-dir`: `<CASE>\runs\rv-hub\<RUN-ID>\`. The GUI uses its *Output folder* field (or the case folder) |
| Case folder | wherever you create it with `--case-dir` (`case.json`, `case-log.jsonl`, `evidence\`, `runs\`) |
| GUI settings | not persisted: each start uses the defaults; every change made before a run is recorded in that run's audit log (`ui_*`) |
| Signing certificate | wherever you keep it; only its path, subject and SHA-256 fingerprint are logged, never the password |
| Local data, caches, temporary files | none |

## 10. Uninstall

- **Installer:** *Settings → Apps → Installed apps → RV Hub → Uninstall*, or run
  `"%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Rakvor\RV Hub\unins000.exe"`. It removes the installed files and shortcuts. The user
  **PATH entry is not removed** in this version; remove it with:

  ```powershell
  $dir = "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Programs\Rakvor\RV Hub"
  $p = [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "User").Split(";") | Where-Object { $_ -and $_ -ne $dir }
  [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", ($p -join ";"), "User")
  ```

- **Portable:** delete the folder.
- **Kept on purpose** (both cases): run outputs and case folders (case material). Keep the release zip and
  `SHA256SUMS` of every version used in a case, so it can be re-run.

## 11. Installation troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause and fix |
| --- | --- |
| SmartScreen "Windows protected your PC" | Unsigned release (step 4 `NotSigned`). Only after steps 2–3 pass: *More info → Run anyway*. |
| `rv-hub` is not recognised | PATH task not selected, or the terminal was opened before installing: open a new terminal or use the full path. |
| `self-test` prints `FAIL` | Do not use this build for evidence; re-download and repeat steps 2–4. |
| Sample summary differs from step 6 | Wrong version or modified sample files; compare `environment.json` with the release notes and the sample digests with `expected_hashes.csv`. |
| GUI window blank or very slow on a VM | No GPU driver: software rendering is used; give the VM more CPU. |
| Building from source downloads another compiler | Expected: rustup installs the pinned 1.97.0 from `rust-toolchain.toml`. Offline, install it beforehand (`rustup toolchain install 1.97.0 --profile minimal`). |
