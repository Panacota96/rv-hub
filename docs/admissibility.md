## 1. Purpose and how to read this page

RV Hub is used **locally** by Rakvor; it is not distributed. Clients, courts and opposing experts may audit it
and rebuild it from source under the Rakvor Source-Auditable Licence ([LICENSE](../LICENSE), draft pending legal
review). Its results are **observations for an examiner, never a verdict**
([theory.md](theory.md#a1-what-the-tool-is-and-is-not)). Admissibility and weight are decided by a court about the
**examiner's evidence**, of which the tool's output is one part. Status values used below:

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **met** | A tool feature satisfies or directly supports the requirement (the file or command is named) |
| **partial** | Supported, with a named shortfall |
| **examiner** | An obligation of the examiner or of Rakvor as a firm, not a tool feature |
| **gap** | Not met today; listed in the [consolidated gap list](#consolidated-gap-list) with a mitigation and an owner |
| **context** | Background that frames the other rows |

**Verification marks** (kept from the research note; never upgraded here):

| Mark | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **[V]** | Article or clause number and substance checked against the primary text (project document, official gazette or faithful mirror). Quoted fragments are verbatim. |
| **[S]** | Checked against a secondary source (Conseil constitutionnel dossier, law-firm note, Rama Judicial cartilla). The number is reliable; check the wording before quoting. |
| **to be verified** | Marked UNVERIFIED in the research: from general professional knowledge, or the primary text could not be reached. **Do not cite before a lawyer or engineer has checked it against the primary source.** |

Research limits that still apply (pass 2 of the research note): the Colombian project PDFs `Ley_906_de_2004.pdf`,
`Ley_1564_de_2012.pdf` and `manualcadena2.pdf` were verified against official web copies, not the project files —
**re-check quoted fragments against the project PDFs before publishing**; the ISO/IEC 27037 copy was the free
preview (table of contents and clauses 1–4), and the clause text of 27037 §5–7, 27041 and 27042 is paywalled;
Légifrance refused automated access (CPP, Code civil and décret 2017-1416 read from the Pappers LEGI mirror). Still
**to be verified**: Daubert/Kumho citations; CPP art. 427, Code civil art. 1358 and CPC arts. 16, 233, 237, 238,
276; loi Informatique et Libertés art. 46 and Directive 2016/680 applicability; NIST FIPS 180-4/202; Decreto
2364/2012, RNBD thresholds, CSJ penal 29.877 holding, C-604/16 and the CGP art. 226 look-back periods; the ANSSI
PRIS content.

Domain features named below: **type detection by magic bytes** (15 signatures, `EXTENSION_MISMATCH`,
`EXECUTABLE_CONTENT`), **duplicate detection** by primary digest, and the **intake role**: this tool writes the
case registry that every later tool verifies against ([theory.md B4–B5, B7](theory.md#b4-type-detection-by-magic-bytes-and-extension-mismatch)).

## 3. The reliability argument

Courts in all four traditions ask, in different words, whether the method is **reliable** and whether it was
**reliably applied** in this case. Colombia's Ley 906 art. 422 lists Daubert-like criteria ([V]); France leaves
evidence free but weighs it; ISO/IEC 27041 (to be verified) asks for validation before use and verification by
each user, and ISO/IEC 17025 §7.2.2 [V] requires a validation record; the US FRE 702 (2023 amendment, [V]) and
Daubert/Kumho (to be verified) give the vocabulary opposing experts use.

| Factor | What the tool offers (evidence an examiner can show) | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Testability** — can the method be tested? | Deterministic digests and findings ([theory.md B11](theory.md#b11-determinism-and-repeatability)); sample with independently computed digests (F11); unit and integration tests on Windows and Linux (F14); tamper tests for both chains (F13); every digest can be re-computed with any standard utility (`sha256sum`, `Get-FileHash`) | met |
| **Known or potential error rate, and limits** | Digests: published algorithms with known-answer tests (F10) and an independent re-computation in CI (F12). Type detection: every finding states what it does not prove (F8); 4 limitations in every report (F9); signature table and decision rule published ([theory.md B4](theory.md#b4-type-detection-by-magic-bytes-and-extension-mismatch)). **No measured false-positive / false-negative rates** for type detection (G5) | partial |
| **Peer review / independent oracles** | Source auditable (F17); Python re-implementation of the chain and of the hashing (F12, in CI); pyHanko validation of every signed PDF (in CI); Python profile of the whole tool (identical findings and item numbering measured on the sample; its case folders verified in CI); OpenSSL for timestamps (manual). No publication or external review (G7) | partial |
| **Standards controlling the operation** | FIPS 180-4/202, RFC 1321 for digests; RFC 3161, RFC 5652 for timestamps and signatures; ISO/IEC 27037 principles ([section 6.1](#61-isoiec-270372012--identification-collection-acquisition-and-preservation-of-digital-evidence)); release verification ([installation.md](installation.md)); examiner checklist (below). No enforced hash policy (G11); no formal SOP signed by the firm | partial |
| **General acceptance** | Cryptographic hashing of evidence and file-signature identification are standard forensic practice; digests agree with standard utilities and with Python `hashlib` (F12) | met |
| **Validation for intended use** (ISO/IEC 17025 §7.2.2 [V]; 27041 — to be verified) | Inputs exist (F10–F14) but there is **no per-release validation report** with plan, acceptance criteria, results and sign-off (G6) | gap |
| **Verification by the user** before casework (17025 §7.2.1 [V]; 27041 — to be verified) | `self-test` + sample run with known expected summary ([installation.md](installation.md#6-first-run-self-test-and-sample)) | met |
| **Reliable application in this case** (FRE 702(d), 2023 — [V]) | Every step of the run in the audit chain (F3), environment pinned (F4), case-folder cross-links (F18), timestamp (F5), signed report (F6) | met |

## 4. Colombia

### 4.1 Ley 906 de 2004 (Código de Procedimiento Penal)

Context: adversarial criminal procedure; digital items are *elementos materiales probatorios / evidencia física*
(EMP/EF) and data messages are expressly included (art. 275 lit. g). Authenticity rests on the chain of custody

### 4.4 Fiscalía chain-of-custody manuals

Context: the project doc `manualcadena2.pdf` is the earlier *Manual de Procedimientos para Cadena de Custodia*
(ISBN 958-97542-8-7; cites Res. 0-2869/2003 and Res. 0-6394/2004). The current manual is *Manual del Sistema de
Cadena de Custodia* v4 (2018), adopted by Acuerdo 001 of 18 April 2018 of the Consejo Nacional de Policía
Judicial. **Neither has a procedure specific to digital evidence**; fill that with ISO/IEC 27037 and the Rama
Judicial cartilla. Both read via Fiscalía PDFs ([S]: AI-summarised extraction — check quotes against the PDF).

### 4.5 Ley 1581 de 2012 (personal data)

Context: evidence nearly always contains personal data, including sensitive data (art. 5). Relevant exceptions:
public entity in its functions or court order (art. 10 lit. a); sensitive data for the "defensa de un derecho en un
proceso judicial" (art. 6 lit. d). Rakvor is usually an *Encargado* for a client *Responsable* (art. 3). Text from

which separates *autenticidad* from *veracidad* and applies art. 11 Ley 527. The cartilla also cites the Raúl
Reyes computers: the INTERPOL 2008 report (conclusion 3) found "48.055 archivos" with timestamps changed by direct
access without imaging or write-blocking, presented with **CSJ Sala de Casación Penal, proceso 29.877** (auto

## 5. France and the European Union

### 5.1 Code de procédure pénale (CPP)

Context: evidence is free in criminal matters (principle of art. 427 — wording **to be verified**), so probative
weight and procedural regularity matter more than admissibility. Data are seized as the medium or "une copie
réalisée en présence des personnes qui assistent à la perquisition" (art. 56 al. 5; art. 97), inventoried and
sealed. A *personne qualifiée* may open seals "pour réaliser une ou plusieurs copies … sans porter atteinte à leur
intégrité", reporting "conformément aux articles 163 et 166" (art. 60-3). Experts come from the Cour de cassation
and cour d'appel lists (art. 157); non-listed experts swear each time (art. 160). Texts from justice.pappers.fr
(LEGI mirror) [V] unless marked.

**Recodification.** Ordonnance n° 2025-1091 of 19 Nov. 2025 rewrote the legislative part of the CPP; arts. 56, 60,
60-3, 97, 157, 160, 163 and 166 are shown as "sera abrogé le 1 janvier 2029". **Article numbers change on

### 5.2 Civil side: Code civil, décret 2017-1416, Code de procédure civile

Context: C. civ. art. 1366 (LEGIARTI000032042461) makes an electronic writing equal to paper "sous réserve que puisse
être dûment identifiée la personne dont il émane et qu'il soit établi et conservé dans des conditions de nature à en
garantir l'intégrité" ([V]). Art. 1367 al. 2 (LEGIARTI000032042456) requires "l'usage d'un procédé fiable
d'identification garantissant son lien avec l'acte auquel elle s'attache", presumed reliable "jusqu'à preuve
contraire" under decree conditions ([V]). Décret 2017-1416 art. 1 (JORFTEXT000035676246) limits the presumption to
a procedure that "met en œuvre une signature électronique qualifiée" (eIDAS arts. 26, 28, 29) ([V]). Art. 1368
(LEGIARTI000032042451): "A défaut de dispositions ou de conventions contraires, le juge règle les conflits de preuve
par écrit en déterminant par tout moyen le titre le plus vraisemblable" ([V]). Cass. 1re civ., 7 Oct. 2020,
n° 19-18.135: a signature electronic under eIDAS but not reliable under art. 1367 did not create a valid electronic
writing ([S], via CMS). Art. 1358 and CPC arts. 233, 237, 238, 263–284-1, 145: **to be verified**.

### 5.3 eIDAS — Regulation (EU) 910/2014 as amended by (EU) 2024/1183

Verified [V] against the EUR-Lex consolidated text CELEX 02014R0910-20241018 (includes Regulation (EU) 2024/1183
and the 2025 corrigendum). Changes by 2024/1183 relevant here [V]: arts. 25(3) and 41(3) are **deleted**; art. 26
gained a paragraph 2 (implementing acts); art. 42 gained **paragraph 1a** — "Compliance with the requirements laid
down in paragraph 1 shall be presumed where the binding of date and time to data and the accuracy of the time source
comply with the standards … referred to in paragraph 2"; art. 42(2) now requires a list of reference standards by
implementing act, which is Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2025/1929 of 29 Sept. 2025 ([S]; its annex
standards **to be verified**).

What an RFC 3161 timestamp from a **non-qualified** TSA does and does not give (legal analysis for counsel; the
quoted article text is [V]):

- **Gives:** cryptographic proof that the audit chain head existed no later than the TSA time, signed by the TSA
  key; under art. 41(1) it "shall not be denied legal effect and admissibility as evidence in legal proceedings
  solely on the grounds that it is in an electronic form or that it does not meet the requirements of the qualified
  electronic time stamp". With F3, every entry up to the covered one existed by then and was not changed afterwards
  (assuming SHA-256 collision resistance).
- **Does not give:** the art. 41(2) presumption "of the accuracy of the date and the time it indicates and the
  integrity of the data to which the date and time are bound" (qualified ETS from a QTSP on an EU Trusted List,
  art. 42); any statutory status in Colombia (Ley 527 art. 30 #5); proof of anything before intake; proof of when
  individual entries were written (only the head is stamped); coverage of the entries written after the token (the
  statistics report and `run_finished`, [theory.md B8](theory.md#b8-rfc-3161-trusted-timestamp)).
- **Consequence:** Rakvor carries the burden of showing the TSA's reliability: policy OID, clock source,
  certificate chain and revocation at stamping time. `verify-log` does **not** check these (G18): run the OpenSSL
  check in the [checklist](#examiner-checklist-before-filing-a-report).

## Consolidated gap list

G1–G17 come from the research note (numbering shared by every Rakvor tool); G18 onwards were found while
documenting the code of this commit. Owners: **Eng.** = engineering (tool), **Counsel**, **Examiner**, **Firm** =
Rakvor management.

| ID | Gap | Affected | Mitigation now | Remedy | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| G1 | No ISO/IEC 17025 accreditation (COFRAC/ONAC), no scope aligned with Global ACI-TECH-1-004 (formerly ILAC G19) (Ley 906 art. 275 lit. h names "laboratorios … oficialmente aceptados") | ISO-18, UK-1, US-7 | State "not accredited" in the report | Accreditation roadmap | Firm |
| G2 | RFC 3161 TSA not qualified (no eIDAS 41(2) presumption) and not a Colombian ECD (Ley 527 art. 30 #5) | EU-4, EU-5, CO-L9 | `--tsa-url` to a QTSP (France; art. 42(1a) presumption via the CIR 2025/1929 standards) or an ONAC-accredited ECD (Colombia); record the TSA chain in the case file | Dual-stamp cross-border cases; record policy OID and chain in the output | Eng. + Counsel |
| G3 | Reports signed with the examiner's own certificate: not a QES, not a Colombian *firma digital* with the art. 28 presumption | FR-C2, FR-C3, CO-L8, CO-L10 | Publish the certificate fingerprint (logged as `signing_certificate_loaded`) out of band | Support qualified certificates on a QSCD / ECD-issued certificates (today: RSA `.p12` only) | Eng. + Examiner |
| G4 | Validation of signature trust chains inside evidence — **not applicable** to this tool (it does not examine signatures); kept for numbering | EU-6 | — | — | — |
| G6 | No per-release validation record (plan, criteria, results, limitations, sign-off), no re-validation trigger | ISO-12, ISO-13, US-2, US-12, UK-1, CO-P14, CO-C6 | Keep CI logs and the sample run of the installed version with the case | CI-generated, signed `validation-report` per tag, listed in SHA256SUMS, following 17025 §7.2.2.4 and SWGDE 18-Q-001-2.1 §6; test dataset separate from development data; independent reviewer where possible (SWGDE §5.6) | Eng. + Firm |
| G7 | No peer-reviewed publication or external review of the tool | CO-P16, US-5, CO-P15 | Offer source review to opposing experts | White paper; external review under NDA | Firm |
| G8 | Examiner status: not on French lists, oath per appointment; Colombian *certificado de idoneidad* and CGP art. 226 disclosures | FR-P5, FR-P7, FR-P8, CO-P11, CO-P12, CO-C3 | Examiner prepares these documents | Add CGP art. 226 #1–10 and CPP art. 166 fields (incl. assistants) to the templates | Examiner + Eng. |
| G9 | F7 are "style" forms, not the official Fiscalía *Registro*; French scellés are created by OPJ/judge/clerk. Missing fields: position (cargo), ID type, witnesses present, official EMP/EF code, seal opening/re-sealing | CO-F2, CO-F3, CO-P3, FR-P1, FR-P2, FR-P9 | Label F7 as an internal custody record; use the official forms alongside | Add the missing fields; map to the official forms | Eng. + Counsel |
| G10 | F1 is software read-only, not a hardware write-blocker (Raúl Reyes / INTERPOL precedent) | CO-J7, ISO-7 | Work only on images or write-blocked devices; record blocker model, serial and test in the case notes | Record write-blocker details in F3 / the case log | Examiner + Eng. |
| G11 | Hash policy allows md5/sha1-only pairs. SWGDE 12-f-002 accepts MD5/SHA-1 for integrity verification but recommends SHA-2/SHA-3 and requires them to identify files without inspection; BLAKE3 is not NIST-approved and less familiar to courts | ISO-6, US-13 | Always select `sha256` (or `sha512`) as one of the two (checklist) | Require SHA-256/512 as one of the two; MD5/SHA-1 only as legacy second hash | Eng. |
| G12 | Audit log uses the host clock; only the chain head is stamped | CO-J7, CO-L4 | Check the workstation's time sync before the run; note it | Record clock source and NTP offset in F4 at start and end; optional stamp at intake | Eng. |
| G13 | Personal data: no retention/deletion tooling, no encryption at rest or access control of outputs | CO-D4, EU-D4, EU-D6 | Encrypted case volume | Firm policies; retention and secure-deletion logs | Firm |
| G14 | Moving legal references: CPP renumbering on 1 Jan. 2029 (ordonnance 2025-1091); Ley 527 art. 10 cites the repealed CPC | FR-P14, CO-L1 | Cite with the version date | Concordance table on this page | Counsel |
| G15 | Scope: no imaging, live, cloud or mobile acquisition | ISO-11 | Declared; use dedicated acquisition tools | — | Examiner |
| G16 | No ANSSI PRIS qualification (market positioning, not admissibility) | §5.5 | — | Optional roadmap item | Firm |
| G17 | Source access offered without a defined protocol; the Rakvor Source-Auditable Licence is a draft pending legal review | CO-P17, FR-P11, CO-C5 | Provide the exact tagged source on request | Standard NDA and inspection protocol (escrow or supervised review); finalise the licence | Firm + Counsel |
| G18 | `verify-log` / `verify-case` check the token's imprint, status and file digest, but **not** the TSA signature, certificate chain, policy or accuracy | EU-4, CO-L9 | `openssl ts -verify` against the TSA chain (checklist step 9) | Verify the token signature and chain in `verify-log` | Eng. |
| G19 | No command re-verifies report files against the digests in the audit log | ISO-1, CO-P2 | Script in [usage.md](usage.md#8-verifying-a-run) | `verify-run` command | Eng. |
| G20 | Truncation of a run's `audit.jsonl` (entries removed from the end) is detectable only against a record kept outside the log. `verify-log` now checks the RFC 3161 timestamp (`covers_seq`) and, for a run in a case folder, the head recorded at `run_finished` in the case log, and reports which entries are anchored. Residual: a standalone run without a timestamp prints `truncation not detectable without a timestamp or case record`; the 3 entries written after a standalone run's timestamp are reported as not provable | ISO-1, CO-P5 | Timestamp every run (or run with `--case-dir`); keep the head printed in the statistics report with the case file | Optional final timestamp after `run_finished` for standalone runs | Eng. |
| G21 | Re-hash of the evidence against the registry — **closed**: `verify-case --rehash` re-hashes every registered item still reachable and reports differences (exit 3); unreachable items are listed as warnings; kept for numbering | — | — | — | — |
| G22 | Release binaries are not bit-for-bit reproducible (no path remapping, PE link data, zip timestamps). The workflows install the toolchain pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml` (`rustup toolchain install`; a test fails if a workflow uses a floating `stable`) | ISO-3, CO-P17 | Provenance attestation + `environment.json` (`tool.rustc`) + functional equivalence ([installation.md](installation.md#8-build-from-source-for-auditors)) | Path remapping, deterministic packaging | Eng. |
| G24 | Independent validation of the report signatures — **closed**: the trust test validates every signed PDF with pyHanko ([tests/validate_pdf_signature.py](../tests/validate_pdf_signature.py): intact and valid; the test CA is not a trusted root); kept for numbering | — | — | — | — |
| G25 | Cross-profile reproducibility of item numbering — **closed**: both profiles sort items by the normalised path, bytewise (UTF-8); the cross-profile test compares the numbering, and CI verifies a case folder written by the Python profile ([tests/golden/](../tests/golden/regenerate.py)) without the other repository; kept for numbering | — | — | — | — |

Gaps specific to this tool's domain (inventory and type detection):

| ID | Gap | Affected | Mitigation now | Remedy | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| G5 | Unknown error rates and coverage of type detection (15 signatures; 2-byte `MZ` and GZIP magics; containers typed by their outer format) | CO-P15, CO-P16, CO-J8, ISO-17, US-6 | Present type findings as observations; confirm executables with a PE/ELF parser and mismatches with a format-aware tool | Labelled corpus; publish FP/FN rates per signature and release; extend the table | Eng. |
| G23 | Files without an extension, or with an extension unknown to the table, are never compared (a program named `invoice` gives no finding) | CO-P15, ISO-4 | Review the `detected_type` column of the statistics report for executables regardless of findings | Flag executables whatever the extension | Eng. |
| G26 | Sample scripts checking the tool's output — **closed**: `run.sh` and `run.ps1` compare the tool's `hashes.csv` (size, SHA-256, MD5) with `expected_hashes.csv` and fail on any difference; kept for numbering | — | — | — | — |
<!-- /forge:domain -->

## Examiner checklist before filing a report

1. **Mandate and legal basis** are documented (order, contract, consent; Ley 1581 / GDPR basis; processor
   contract). Fees are not contingent on the outcome (CGP art. 235).
2. **Competence documents** are ready: Colombia — title/competence, *certificado de idoneidad*, CGP art. 226
   disclosures #1–#7; France — list status or oath (CPP arts. 157, 160).
3. **The installed tool was verified**: `SHA256SUMS`, provenance attestation and (if signed) Authenticode checked;
   `rv-hub self-test` passed; the sample run gave the expected summary on this workstation
   ([installation.md](installation.md)). Keep the outputs.
4. **The evidence received is a verified copy** (image or write-blocked export); write-blocker model, serial and
   test are in the case notes (G10).
5. **Hash policy**: one of the two algorithms is `sha256` or `sha512` (MD5/SHA-1 only as a second, legacy hash).
6. **The workstation clock** was synchronised before the run; note the time source.
7. **The run is complete**: the audit log ends with `run_finished` (not `run_failed` / `run_cancelled`), and
   `rv-hub verify-log <log folder>` prints `OK` with a `truncation:` line naming its anchor (the timestamp or
   the case log), not `truncation not detectable without a timestamp or case record` (G20).
8. **Independent chain check**: `python tests/verify_chain.py <log folder>` exits 0 (it also re-hashes the evidence
   listed in `hashes.csv`).
9. **Timestamp**: `timestamp_obtained` is present (or obtained later with `rv-hub timestamp`), and the token was
   verified with OpenSSL against the TSA's certificate chain: `openssl ts -verify -digest <head> -in
   timestamp-<N>.tsr -CAfile <TSA chain>` ([usage.md](usage.md#6-timestamps)). For proceedings needing a
   presumption, a qualified (EU) or ECD (Colombia) TSA was used.
10. **Outputs match the log**: report files re-hashed against the audited digests ([usage.md](usage.md#8-verifying-a-run)).
11. **Case folder** (when used): `rv-hub verify-case <CASE> --rehash` prints `OK` and re-hashes every
    registered item reachable from the workstation (unreachable items are listed); every analysis run shows
    `evidence_verified_against_case` for the items relied on; any `EVIDENCE_HASH_MISMATCH_WITH_CASE` or
    `EVIDENCE_NOT_IN_CASE_REGISTRY` is explained in the report.
12. **Limitations** of the report (F9) are kept, plus case-specific ones.
13. **Custody**: the official custody form (Fiscalía *Registro* or scellés record) is completed alongside the
    tool's internal form; missing fields (cargo, ID type, witnesses, assistants) are filled by hand (G9).
14. **The report is signed** with the examiner's certificate (`--sign-cert`); the certificate's SHA-256
    fingerprint printed on the reports matches the one published out of band; for a presumption of reliability,
    a qualified certificate was used (G3).
15. **The case file keeps together**: evidence copy, the case folder (or `logs/<RUN-ID>/` incl. `.tsr` and
    `reports/<RUN-ID>/`), `environment.json`, the tool release (zip + SHA256SUMS) and this page's version (git
    commit).
16. **Disclosure**: the opposing party can obtain the tool version, the outputs and access to the source under the
    inspection protocol (G17); Colombia: summary report ≥ 5 days before the hearing (Ley 906 art. 415).
17. **Counsel reviewed** the legal statements of the report for the jurisdiction and date (CPP renumbering in 2029,
    G14).

<!-- forge:domain -->
Domain steps for this tool:

18. **Every `UNREADABLE` item** was re-acquired or explained; unreadable items are not registered in the case.
19. **Every `EXECUTABLE_CONTENT`** was confirmed with a PE/ELF parser and handled as potentially hostile; every
    `EXTENSION_MISMATCH` relied on was confirmed by opening the file with a suitable tool.
20. **Duplicates** relied on were computed with SHA-256 (or stronger) as the primary algorithm.
