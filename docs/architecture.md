# Architecture

One engine, two front-ends. The engine (`src/core`) does all the work and never prints; the CLI and
the GUI only turn user input into a `RunConfig` and render the `Event`s the engine emits. This is why
both interfaces always produce identical logs and reports.

        CLI["rv-hub (src/cli)<br/>clap · indicatif"]
        GUI["rv-hub-gui (src/gui)<br/>egui · wgpu"]
    end
    subgraph Core["rv_hub_core (src/core)"]
        RUN["run.rs<br/>pipeline"]
        IN["input.rs"]
        H["hash.rs"]
        AN["analyzer.rs<br/>(domain logic)"]
        AU["audit.rs"]
        CA["case.rs<br/>case folder"]
        REP["report/<br/>JSON · HTML · PDF"]
        I18N["i18n.rs"]
    end
    CLI -- RunConfig --> RUN
    GUI -- "RunConfig (+ UI actions)" --> RUN
    RUN -- "Event stream" --> CLI
    RUN -- "Event stream (mpsc)" --> GUI
    RUN --> IN & H & AN & AU & REP & CA
    CA --> AU
    REP --> I18N
```

## Modules

| Module | Responsibility | Replace when building a new tool? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `input.rs` | Files, folders, list files → sorted, de-duplicated, absolute paths. Symlinks not followed. | No |
| `hash.rs` | One read loop (1 MiB chunks) feeding 1–2 digests; known-answer self-test. | No |
| `analyzer.rs` | Signature detection and per-item findings. | **Yes — this is the domain logic** |
| `audit.rs` | Append-only hash-chained `audit.jsonl` + `audit.log`; `verify`. | No |
| `case.rs` | Shared case folder: `case.json`, hash-chained `case-log.jsonl` under a lock, evidence registry, `verify_case`. Role = `CASE_ROLE` (intake here, analysis in scaffolded tools). See [case-folder.md](case-folder.md). | No (flip `CASE_ROLE`) |
| `report/` | View models → minijinja HTML, built-in PDF writer, schema-versioned JSON. | Adapt wording/fields |
| `events.rs` | Typed events; ETA computation. | No |
| `env.rs` | `environment.json` (versions, OS, host, user, command line). | No |
| `run.rs` | Orchestration, cancellation, duplicates, `hashes.csv`. | Small changes |

## One run, step by step

```mermaid

    participant UI as CLI / GUI
    participant R as run.rs
    participant A as audit.jsonl
    participant FS as Evidence (read-only)
    participant O as reports/
    UI->>R: run(config, sink, cancel)

    R->>R: collect inputs
    R->>A: inputs_resolved

    loop each item
        R->>A: item_started
        R->>FS: open read-only, read 1 MiB chunks
        R-->>UI: Progress{elapsed_ms, eta_ms} (≤ every 150 ms)
        R->>A: item_hashed{digests, mtime_unchanged}
        R->>A: item_analyzed{findings, status}
        R-->>UI: ItemFinished
    end
    R->>A: duplicate_group(s), hash_register_written
    R->>O: per-item technical + summary (JSON/HTML/PDF)
    R->>A: item_reports_written{file digests}
    R->>O: statistics (JSON/HTML/PDF)
    R->>A: statistics_report_written, run_finished
    R-->>UI: RunFinished
```

## Run states (as the GUI sees them)

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Idle
    Idle --> Running: Start (inputs ≥ 1, algorithms 1–2)
    Running --> Finished: RunFinished
    Running --> Cancelled: Cancel → partial reports
    Running --> Failed: error (e.g. output not writable)
    Finished --> Running: Start again (new run ID)
    Cancelled --> Running
    Failed --> Running
```

## Concurrency and cancellation

- The GUI runs the engine on a worker thread and receives events through a channel, so the window stays
  responsive; the elapsed-time label is refreshed every 200 ms from the window clock.
- Cancellation is an `AtomicBool` checked after every 1 MiB chunk: large images stop within milliseconds.
  The engine still writes `hashes.csv`, partial reports and `run_cancelled` to the audit log.
- Files are processed sequentially on purpose: the order of audit entries equals the order of work, which is
  easier to explain in court. Hashing is I/O-bound on typical evidence drives.
