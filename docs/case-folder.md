# Case folder

Every Rakvor tool can work alone (`--out DIR`). In a real engagement the tools share **one case folder**
(`--case-dir`): rv-hub, the **intake** tool, registers each evidence file once and gives it an evidence id
(`E0001`, `E0002`, …); every later **analysis** tool re-hashes each file, compares it with that registry and links
its own audit chain to the case. A reviewer can then follow one item from intake to the last report, across tools,
and check that nothing changed in between.

```mermaid

    E[(Evidence<br/>read-only)] --> H["rv-hub (intake)<br/>--case-dir CASE"]
    H --> R[["evidence/registry.json<br/>E0001…: path, size, hashes"]]
    H --> CL[["case-log.jsonl<br/>hash-chained"]]

    P --> CL
    H --> RH["runs/rv-hub/RUN-ID/"]
    P --> RP["runs/&lt;tool&gt;/RUN-ID/"]
```

The contract (schemas, events, rules) is the same in the Rust and Python profiles, and a case written by one is
read and extended by the other (tested in CI when both are present).

## Layout (`rakvor.case/1`)

```text
<CASE>/
  case.json                   {"schema":"rakvor.case/1","case_id","jurisdiction","created_utc",
                               "created_by":{"tool","version","run_id","actor"}}       (written once)
  case-log.jsonl              hash-chained case log (same algorithm as audit.jsonl), append-only
  case-log.lock               exists only while a tool appends (created exclusively, then removed)
  evidence/registry.json      {"schema":"rakvor.registry/1","items":[{"evidence_id","path","size","hashes",
                               "registered_by":{"tool","version","run_id","audit_seq"},"registered_utc"}]}
  evidence/registry.csv       evidence_id,path,size,<algorithms>,run_id
  runs/<tool>/<RUN-ID>/logs/     audit.jsonl, audit.log, hashes.csv, environment.json, timestamp-*.tsr|.json
  runs/<tool>/<RUN-ID>/reports/  statistics.*, items/<NNNNN>-<NAME>/{technical,summary,custody}.*
```

JSON schemas: [case.schema.json](../schemas/case.schema.json) and [registry.schema.json](../schemas/registry.schema.json).

## Using it

```bash
# 1. Open the case and register the evidence (creates case.json; --case and --jurisdiction are needed only now)
rv-hub scan -i D:\evidence -r --case-dir E:\CASE-014 --case CASE-014 --jurisdiction fr
# 2. Re-examine some registered items later (or run an analysis tool with the same --case-dir)
rv-hub scan --case-dir E:\CASE-014 --evidence E0001,E0002
# 3. Check the whole case before handing it over
rv-hub verify-case E:\CASE-014
```

In the GUI, fill **Case folder** in section 1. The output folder is then derived (`<case>/runs/rv-hub/<RUN-ID>`)
and locked, the change is audited (`ui_case_dir_changed`), and the result panel lists the evidence id of every
item.

| Option | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `--case-dir DIR` | Work in this case folder (created when it has no `case.json`). `--out` is not used. |
| `--case ID` | Names the case at creation; afterwards it must match `case.json` (or be left out). |
| `--jurisdiction co\|fr` | Set at creation; later runs use the case's jurisdiction for custody forms. |
| `--evidence E0001,E0007` | Examine these registered items (no `--input` needed). |
| no `--input` | Every registered item is examined. |

## Roles

The role is one constant: `CASE_ROLE` (`src/core/src/lib.rs`) and `"case_role"` in `.forge.json`. The reference
rv-hub is `intake`; a tool scaffolded from it is `analysis`. Both behaviours live in the shared code and are
tested in both profiles.

| | Intake (rv-hub) | Analysis (later tools) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Registry | Registers every successfully hashed item | Never writes it |
| Same path, same content | Keeps the existing id (`already_registered`) | `evidence_verified_against_case` (match) |
| Same path, other content | New id + finding `REGISTRY_PATH_CONTENT_CHANGED` (medium) | Finding `EVIDENCE_HASH_MISMATCH_WITH_CASE` (**high**); the analysis still runs |
| Not in the registry | Registered (new id) | Finding `EVIDENCE_NOT_IN_CASE_REGISTRY` (medium) |
| Matching order | — | `--evidence` id, else same path, else same content |

**Hash algorithms.** A case run always includes at least one algorithm present in every registered item. If the
user picked a disjoint set, SHA-256 (or the registry's algorithm) is added — or replaces the second choice, since
the two-algorithm limit still holds — and the change is audited as `case_algorithm_added`.

## Events

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant T as Tool run
    participant L as case-log.lock
    participant C as case-log.jsonl
    participant R as registry.json
    participant A as runs/tool/RUN/logs/audit.jsonl
    T->>L: create (exclusive)
    T->>C: verify chain + registry digest
    T->>C: run_started {run_dir, role}
    T->>L: remove
    T->>A: run_started, case_linked {case_log_head_at_start}
    T->>A: item_hashed … evidence_verified_against_case / evidence_registered
    opt intake
        T->>L: create
        T->>R: add new ids, write registry.json + .csv
        T->>C: evidence_registered {evidence_ids, added, registry_sha256}
        T->>L: remove
    end
    T->>A: … run_finished (final audit head)
    T->>L: create
    T->>C: run_finished {audit_head, audit_entries, status, totals, verification}
    T->>L: remove
```

| Case-log event | Written by | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `case_created` | first tool | case_id, jurisdiction, schema, `case_json_sha256`, `registry_sha256: null` |
| `run_started` | every tool | tool, version, `run_dir` (relative), frontend, role, evidence_ids |
| `evidence_registered` | intake tool | evidence_ids (all of this run), added (new ones), registry_items, `registry_sha256` |
| `run_finished` | every tool, also after a cancel or a failure | status `completed`/`cancelled`/`failed`, `audit_head`, `audit_entries`, timestamp_status, totals, verification {registered, added, verified, mismatched, unregistered} |

Run audit (`audit.jsonl`) events added by the case folder: `case_linked` (entry #2, right after `run_started`),
`case_algorithm_added`, `evidence_registered`, `evidence_verified_against_case`, `evidence_not_in_case_registry`.

**The two chains vouch for each other.** `case_linked.case_log_head_at_start` is the hash of the run's
`run_started` entry in the case log; `run_finished.audit_head` in the case log is the hash of the run's final audit
entry. Editing either side breaks a link.

## Safety rules

- **A broken case is never extended.** Before every append a tool re-verifies the case-log chain, `case.json`
  (digest at creation) and the registry digest; on failure it stops with exit code 3 and writes nothing.
- **One writer at a time.** Appends happen under `case-log.lock` (created exclusively). A tool waits up to 30 s for
  another one; a lock older than 10 minutes is reported as *stale* with its owner, and is **never deleted
  automatically** — a person decides.
- **Only the intake tool writes the registry**, and every change records its new SHA-256 in the case log.
- **Reports name the evidence id** of each item; the custody form uses the case id, the evidence id and the intake
  date from the registry.

## How a reviewer verifies a case

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    A["verify-case CASE"] --> B{"case-log.jsonl<br/>chain intact?"}
    B -- no --> X["BROKEN (exit 3)"]
    B -- yes --> C{"case.json and registry.json<br/>match recorded digests?"}
    C -- no --> X
    C -- yes --> D["for every run_started"]
    D --> E{"run audit.jsonl intact,<br/>timestamps valid?"}
    E -- no --> X
    E -- yes --> F{"case_linked → run_started<br/>and run_finished → final audit entry?"}
    F -- no --> X
    F -- yes --> G{"--rehash: reachable evidence<br/>matches the registry?"}
    G -- no --> X
    G -- "yes / not asked" --> OK["OK (exit 0)<br/>warnings: runs without run_finished,<br/>items not reachable"]
```

1. `rv-hub verify-case <CASE>` (any Rakvor tool has it; they agree). Exit 0 = intact, 3 = broken, 1 = not a
   case folder. Only `timestamp_obtained` may follow a run's recorded final entry (a delayed timestamp).
   `--rehash` also re-hashes every registered item still reachable at its registered path (the latest registration
   of a path) and compares it with the registry: a difference is exit 3, an unreachable item a warning.
   `rv-hub verify-log <CASE>/runs/<tool>/<RUN-ID>/logs` checks one run and anchors its end to `run_finished` in
   the case log.
2. Independently of any Rakvor binary: `python tests/verify_chain.py <CASE>/runs/<tool>/<RUN-ID>/logs` re-checks a
   run; the case log uses the same chain rule, and `sha256sum evidence/registry.json` must equal the last
   `registry_sha256` in `case-log.jsonl`.
3. Re-hash the evidence with any tool and compare it with `evidence/registry.csv` (or `verify-case --rehash`).
4. `python tests/validate_reports.py <CASE>` validates `case.json`, `registry.json` and every JSON report against
   `schemas/`.
