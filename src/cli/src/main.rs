const ABOUT: &str = "Inventory digital evidence: hash every file with one or two algorithms, detect its real type, flag anomalies and write court-ready reports with a tamper-evident audit log.";

const LONG_ABOUT: &str = "\
DESCRIPTION:
  rv-hub reviews a single file, a whole folder (bulk) or a list of files. For every file it:
    1. opens the file read-only and hashes it in one pass with one or two algorithms;
    2. detects the real file type from its signature (magic bytes);
    3. flags empty files, extensions that do not match the content, programs hidden under
       another name and duplicated content;
    4. writes a technical report and a customer-friendly summary (HTML, PDF and JSON).
  Each run also writes a statistics report and an audit trail under <OUT>/logs/<RUN-ID>/.
  Every action is appended to a hash-chained log that `rv-hub verify-log` can check later.

  CASE FOLDER (--case-dir): Rakvor tools share one folder per case. rv-hub is the intake tool: it
  registers every hashed file in evidence/registry.json (evidence ids E0001, E0002, ...) so later tools
  can prove they examined bit-identical copies. `rv-hub verify-case <CASE>` checks it all.";

const SCAN_AFTER_HELP: &str = "\
EXAMPLES:
  Review one file (SHA-256, English reports):
    rv-hub scan --input evidence/contract.pdf
  Review a folder and its subfolders with SHA-256 + MD5, Spanish reports, for case CASE-2026-014:
    rv-hub scan -i D:\\evidence -r --hash sha256,md5 --lang es --case CASE-2026-014
  Review the files listed in a text file, reports in the three languages, machine-readable progress:
    rv-hub scan --input-list files.txt --lang all --progress jsonl > events.jsonl
  Verify the audit log afterwards:
    rv-hub verify-log rakvor-out/logs/<RUN-ID>/audit.jsonl
  Open a case folder and register the evidence (intake), then verify the whole case:
    rv-hub scan -i D:\\evidence -r --case-dir E:\\CASE-014 --case CASE-014 --jurisdiction fr
    rv-hub verify-case E:\\CASE-014
  Re-examine two registered items of the case:
    rv-hub scan --case-dir E:\\CASE-014 --evidence E0001,E0002

EXIT CODES:
  0    Completed; no high-severity finding.
  1    Runtime error (input not found, output not writable, case log locked, ...).
       See the audit log.
  2    Usage error (unknown option, more than two hash algorithms, unsupported language).
       With --case-dir: folder of another case or schema, --case missing when creating the
       case, unknown evidence id.
  3    Completed with at least one high-severity finding (e.g. unreadable file, program under
       another name, evidence that differs from the case registry), or the case folder fails
       verification (nothing is written to it).
  130  Cancelled with Ctrl+C. Partial reports and the cancellation are written to the audit log.

FILES WRITTEN:
  <OUT>/logs/<RUN-ID>/audit.jsonl         Hash-chained log of every action (one JSON object per line).
  <OUT>/logs/<RUN-ID>/audit.log           The same actions, human-readable.
  <OUT>/logs/<RUN-ID>/hashes.csv          Hash register: index, path, size, digests, status.
  <OUT>/logs/<RUN-ID>/environment.json    Tool and dependency versions, OS, host, user, command line.
  <OUT>/reports/<RUN-ID>/statistics.json  Run statistics (+ statistics.<LANG>.html and .pdf).
  <OUT>/reports/<RUN-ID>/items/<NNNNN>-<NAME>/technical.json|.<LANG>.html|.<LANG>.pdf   Technical review.
  <OUT>/reports/<RUN-ID>/items/<NNNNN>-<NAME>/summary.json|.<LANG>.html|.<LANG>.pdf     Customer summary.
  <OUT>/reports/<RUN-ID>/items/<NNNNN>-<NAME>/custody.json|.<es|fr>.html|.pdf|.en.html|.pdf  Custody form.
  <OUT>/logs/<RUN-ID>/timestamp-<SEQ>.tsr|.json  RFC 3161 token for the audit chain head.
  With --case-dir <CASE>, logs/ and reports/ go to <CASE>/runs/rv-hub/<RUN-ID>/, plus:
  <CASE>/case.json                        Case id, jurisdiction, creation (written once).
  <CASE>/case-log.jsonl                   Hash-chained case log of every tool: case_created,
                                          run_started, evidence_registered, run_finished.
  <CASE>/evidence/registry.json|.csv      Evidence registry: E0001..., path, size, hashes.

FORENSIC NOTES:
  - Evidence is opened read-only and never modified; modification times are compared before and after.
  - Work on a verified copy (write-blocked image or export), not on original media.
  - Each audit entry stores the SHA-256 of the previous one; editing, deleting or re-ordering any
    line is detected by `verify-log`. Removing the last lines is detected only against a record
    kept outside the log: the RFC 3161 timestamp or, with --case-dir, the case log. Keep the log
    folder with the reports.
  - A file without findings is not proven authentic; read the Limitations section of each report.
  - MD5 and SHA-1 are accepted for compatibility with older case files; pair them with SHA-256 or BLAKE3.
  - The chain head is timestamped by an RFC 3161 authority (proves when the log existed). Offline? The run
    finishes with `timestamp_pending`; run `rv-hub timestamp <LOG>` later.
  - With --sign-cert every PDF is signed with the examiner's certificate; the password is never logged.
  - Case folder: every tool re-verifies case-log.jsonl and the registry digest before
    writing, and refuses a broken case (exit 3). Appends happen under case-log.lock; a lock
    older than 10 minutes is reported as stale and never deleted automatically.
  - Each run's audit.jsonl records case_linked (the case-log entry it started from); the case
    log records the run's final audit head, so the two chains vouch for each other.";

  - every timestamp token (timestamp-<SEQ>.tsr) covers the hash of the entry it names, and every
    timestamp_obtained entry still has its token file;
  - truncation: a chain alone cannot show that entries were removed from its end. The log must
    still contain the entry covered by its RFC 3161 timestamp (covers_seq) and, for a run inside
    a case folder (<CASE>/runs/<TOOL>/<RUN-ID>/logs), end with the audit head that the case log
    recorded at run_finished (only timestamp_obtained may follow). Entries after the last
    anchored one are listed as not provable; with neither record the output says
    \"truncation not detectable without a timestamp or case record\".
